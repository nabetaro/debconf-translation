Template: debconf/frontend
Type: select
_Choices: Dialog, Readline, Gnome, Kde, Editor, Noninteractive
Default: Dialog
_Description: What interface should be used for configuring packages?
 Packages that use debconf for configuration share a common look and feel.
 You can select the type of user interface they use.
 .
 The dialog frontend is a full-screen, character based interface, while the
 readline frontend uses a more traditional plain text interface, and both the
 gnome and kde frontends are modern X interfaces, fitting the respective
 desktops (but may be used in any X environment). The editor frontend lets you
 configure things using your favorite text editor. The noninteractive
 frontend never asks you any questions.

Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
_Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: medium
_Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than...
 Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they
 might ask you. Only questions with a certain priority or higher are
 actually shown to you; all less important questions are skipped.
 .
 You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see:
  - 'critical' is for items that will probably break the system
     without user intervention.
  - 'high' is for items that don't have reasonable defaults.
  - 'medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.
  - 'low' is for trivial items that have defaults that will work in
    the vast majority of cases.
 .
 For example, this question is of medium priority, and if your priority
 were already 'high' or 'critical', you wouldn't see this question.
